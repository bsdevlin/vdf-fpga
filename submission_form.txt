Team name: Benjamin Devlin
Expected result (avg ns/square): 56.1ns/sq
Design documentation (below):

- Implemented Montgomery multiplication algorithm (chose not to do Barret reduction algorithm as then we need to use subtraction)
  - Optimized to take 3 clock cycles
    - Lower clock network power
  - One squaring, one multiplication where we mask away the upper half, one multiplication with addition where we shift away the lower half
  - We do not require the final check to see if we are larger than the modulus due to increasing the number of words used by 1 in the multiplier
  - Final addition step is combined into the multiplier adder tree to save a clock cycle
  - Only have to check for overflow in one word when doing masking and shifts
- Redundant binary representation of 17 bits for a 16 bit word
- Created a multi-mode multiplier that uses 2272 DSPs to fit on one SLR (2280)
  - Uses control to select what mode (square / lower half / upper half), all control signals are routed through BUFGs, control signals one-hot
  - Calculates 2 additional words past the shift/mask boundary so that we can detect and adjust overflow
- MMCM PLL to allow to adjust clock period after place and route to operate at max frequency
  - We over constrain and then adjust down so timing passes.
- Clock crossing done in wrapper using word FIFOs
- Conversion in and our of Montgomery form is done in the SW wrapper
- Power ramp up not used
- Software model in verilog is in the package file src/rtl/redun_mont_pkg.sv and python in scripts/mont.py
